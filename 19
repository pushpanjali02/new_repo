commit is used to take snapshots
which can be used to the changes made to a brach at every instance (when ever you commited the changes)
branches allows to divide the work into different groups 
using  ""git branch <branch name>"" we can create a new branch
next can commit some changes
we can check the branch using ""git checkout <brach name>""
again to move back to main branch we need to enter ""git checkout main"" command
again we can checkout using "" git checkout main"" command
to merge these 2 branches we have the commad "" git merge <brach name>"" command
